/**
 * IMPORTANT FOR AI:
 * - This is the ONLY game entrypoint that main.ts uses.
 * - You MUST export a `createGame` function that returns a Game instance.
 * - If you create new game files/folders, wire them up through this file.
 * - DO NOT create new top-level entry files outside of src/game/.
 *
 * RULES FOR AI DEVELOPMENT:
 * 1. All game code must live under src/game/
 * 2. This file must always export `createGame(engine: Engine): Game`
 * 3. Do not modify src/main.ts or src/engine/** files
 * 4. Use engine.scene, engine.camera, engine.input, engine.assetLoader
 * 5. Assets go in public/assets/current-game/ and are auto-discovered
